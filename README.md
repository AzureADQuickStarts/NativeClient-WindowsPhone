# This sample has been archived

A newer version of this sample, working for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) as well as iOS and Android is available from [Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-multitarget](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-multitarget).

If you really wish to view the archived sample, please switch to the [complete](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/NativeClient-WindowsPhone/tree/complete) branch. Note that the Windows Phone project does not load in recent versions of Visual Studio. This code is no longer maintained and functionality is not guaranteed.
